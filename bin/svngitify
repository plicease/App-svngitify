=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % svngitify [ -i | --interactive] [ [ -u | --user ] svnuser=gituser ] [ -v | --verbose ] url
 % svngitify --help
 % svngitify --version

url may be a traditional fully qualified URL, or a relative or absolute pathname.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There are lots of HOWTOs on the Interwebs on how to migrate from Subversion
to git.  I got tired of looking one of these up each time I needed to do it
and wrote this script to remember the incantations for me.  This is intended
for a simple one shot, no looking back to Subversion conversion.  If you want
to make changes with git and push them back to Subversion you should instead
of course use C<git-svn>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 --interactive | -i

If there are missing users not specified on the command line open the
user map in a text editor before continuing with the conversion.

=head2 --user | -u

Specify a user mapping.  Can be used multiple times.  Example:

 % svngitify -u plicease='Graham Ollis <plicease@cpan.org>'

=head2 --verbose | -v

Log to stdout, instead of a log file.

=head2 --help | -h

Print help

=head2 --version

Print the version
